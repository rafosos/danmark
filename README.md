# Danmark
Website about my exchange year in Denmark. Just a project so I can practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript later on.
To be quite honest, I have no idea how you came across this project while browsing on GitHub, but anyway, welcome!
I'm still learning how to use GitHub, so I beg your patience with the mess this project might be.
Thanks for the attention!
